A very quick and dirty Breakout / Arkanoid style game.

There are several bugs re: ball collision with object sides (paddle and brick).

All graphics are drawn in-engine (no external images imported).

I'd like to add power-ups at some point, but this was just a warm up to get back into Java Development, and I wrote this in about 5 hours.
