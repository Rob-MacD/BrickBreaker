A very quick and dirty Breakout / Arkanoid style game.
Copyright Rob MacD.

Features:
  - 1 Basic level with multi-colored bricks: Red Bricks have 1 health. Blue 2, Green 3, Yellow 4, Pink 5.
  - Ball increases velocity ever so slightly with each contact with a brick. Starts too slow, ends too fast :P
  - Player starts with 5 Lives.

Known Bugs/Issues:
  - Collision with side of paddle causes ball to travel through paddle.
  - Collision with side of bricks causes ball to travel through bricks, annihilating them regardless of brick strength. 
  - Player lives are not displayed.
  - When game over, only choice is to close game. No reset option.

To-Do:
  - Fix bugs.
  - Add Lives Label.
  - Add a Game Over screen when all remaining lives or bricks are gone, to allow reset option.
  - Implement power-ups.
  - Make new levels, perhaps a random level generator.
  - Make a custom level maker, where player can design their own levels.
